‚è∫ ChatGPT's explanation is more accurate than mine. I was incorrect about needing the local dev server running.

ChatGPT is right:

- Your app connects to the hosted Convex deployment (https://cool-firefly-732.convex.cloud)
- Reads work because query functions are already deployed there
- Writes fail because your mutation functions likely aren't deployed to the hosted deployment yet

The real issue: Your mutation functions in /convex/ haven't been deployed to your hosted Convex deployment.

Quick fix:
npx convex deploy

This will push your local mutation functions (like addHabit, deleteHabit, etc.) to your hosted deployment.

Going forward:

- npx convex dev - auto-deploys as you develop
- npx convex deploy - one-time deploy without local server

Since your frontend uses the hosted URL, you just need to ensure your functions are deployed there. My apologies for the
confusion - ChatGPT nailed the diagnosis.
