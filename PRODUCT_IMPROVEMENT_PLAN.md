# MindMend Product Improvement Plan
*Connecting Habits, Check-ins, and Journal into a Unified Personal Growth Journey*

## 🎯 Strategic Vision
Transform MindMend from disconnected habit tracking + journaling into a **unified personal growth companion** that shows users how their actions (habits), reflections (check-ins/journal), and emotions (mood) interconnect to drive meaningful change.

## 🔍 Current State Analysis
Based on screenshots and codebase review:

**✅ What's Working:**
- Beautiful, calming UI perfect for mental wellness
- Clear habit tracking with streaks and visual feedback  
- Separate journaling and check-in flows are functional
- Good progress indicators and encouraging copy

**❌ Critical Gaps:**
- **Silos**: Habits, check-ins, and journal exist independently
- **No correlation insights**: Users can't see how habits affect mood/progress
- **Duplicated effort**: Check-ins and journal both create separate entries
- **Missing context**: Check-ins don't reference habit performance
- **Weak retention loops**: No unified progress story

---

## 🎯 KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

### Mood Setting Strategy
**Decision**: Journal screen remains the **primary interface** for mood setting
- **Rationale**: Users naturally reflect on mood while journaling
- **Frequency**: Allow multiple mood entries per day tied to journal entries
- **Daily aggregation**: Calculate daily mood range (morning-evening) for insights
- **Display**: Other screens show mood range: "😐→😊 3→7" or latest mood
- **Data**: Continue using `journal_entries.mood_rating` + add mood aggregation logic

### One Source of Truth Principle
**Habits**: Home screen is primary place to toggle completion
**Mood**: Journal screen is primary place to set mood  
**Check-ins**: Check-in screen shows context but doesn't duplicate functionality

### LLM-Based AI Approach
**No machine learning**: Use LLM prompting with structured context instead of statistical analysis
**Confidence qualifiers**: "We've noticed a possible trend..." or "Based on 5 similar days..."
**User feedback loop**: Allow 👍/👎 on insights to improve prompting
**Transparent reasoning**: Show why suggestion was made ("Your mood improved 3/5 days after exercise")
**Context-aware**: Feed full picture (habits + mood + reflections) to LLM for nuanced insights

## 🚀 PHASE 1: CORE INTEGRATION (Weeks 1-3)

### 🏠 HOME SCREEN CHANGES

#### Visual UI Updates
```typescript
// Add above existing habit cards (progressive disclosure design)
<DailySummaryCard>
  - Check-in status: "✅ Morning Done" or "⏳ Evening Pending"
  - Today's mood: "😐→😊 3→7" (range) or "😊 7/10" (single entry)
  - PRIMARY AI insight: "💡 Your mood tends to improve on exercise days"
  - Expandable section: "Show details" → confidence level + reasoning
  - Yesterday comparison: "↗️ +1.5 mood improvement"
</DailySummaryCard>
```

#### Backend Changes
- **Enhanced API**: Extend existing daily stats to include check-in status and insights
- **Use existing**: Leverage `daily_stats` table + `journal_entries` for mood data
- **Response**: `{hasCheckedIn, todaysMood, aiDailySummary, habitCompletion, yesterdayComparison}`

---

### ⚡ CHECK-IN SCREEN CHANGES

#### Visual UI Updates
```typescript
// Add collapsible context section at top
<TodaysContextSection collapsible defaultOpen={false}>
  - Show today's habits: "Exercise ✅" "Meditation ⏳" "No Drinking ❌"
  - Display mood range: "Today's mood: 😐→😊 3→7" 
  - Quick links: "Update habits" (Home) | "Add mood entry" (Journal)
  - AI context prompt: "Based on your progress, how are you feeling about today?"
</TodaysContextSection>
```

#### Backend Changes
- **Enhanced AI**: Use habit completion data to personalize check-in questions
- **Smarter prompts**: "You completed 2/3 habits today - how do you feel about your progress?"
- **Context-aware**: Reference specific habits in evening reflections

---

### 📖 JOURNAL SCREEN CHANGES

#### Visual UI Updates
```typescript
// Keep Journal as PRIMARY mood setting location (existing slider)
// Update History tab with enriched timeline
<DailyTimelineView>
  Per day entry shows:
  - Date + mood emoji + habit completion ratio (from daily_stats)
  - Check-in summary: "Goal: Stay focused, Felt: Good progress"  
  - Journal preview: "Had a tough moment but pushed through..."
  - AI insight badge: "💡 Mood improved after morning walk"
</DailyTimelineView>
```

#### Backend Changes
- **Enhanced API**: Extend existing journal entries API to include daily stats and check-in data
- **Use existing**: Combine `journal_entries`, `daily_stats`, and check-in data in response
- **Single source**: Journal remains the primary mood-setting interface

## 🔧 BACKEND ARCHITECTURE UPDATES

### Leverage Existing Schema
**No new tables needed!** Work with existing structure:

```sql
-- EXISTING: journal_entries (keep as-is, primary mood source)
-- EXISTING: daily_stats (enhance to include check-in status)
-- EXISTING: habit_events (use for correlation analysis)  
-- EXISTING: ai_insights (enhance for pattern insights)

-- ONLY addition: Add check-in tracking to daily_stats
ALTER TABLE daily_stats ADD COLUMN morning_checkin_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE daily_stats ADD COLUMN evening_checkin_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE daily_stats ADD COLUMN checkin_summary TEXT;
```

### Enhanced Existing Tables
**daily_stats**: Add check-in timestamps and summary
**ai_insights**: Use existing table for correlation insights with new insight types
**journal_entries**: Keep as primary mood and reflection storage

### Enhanced API Endpoints
```typescript
// Enhanced existing endpoints (don't replace, extend)
GET /api/daily-stats/:date    // Add check-in status, AI insights
POST /api/check-in           // Store summary in daily_stats.checkin_summary
GET /api/journal-entries     // Include daily_stats data in timeline response

// New insight endpoints  
GET /api/insights/correlations  // Mood-habit pattern analysis
GET /api/insights/daily-summary // Home screen AI summary

// Context endpoints
GET /api/habits/today-status    // Current completion status for check-in context
```

### LLM-Based AI Services Architecture
```typescript
// LLM insight generation service
class LLMInsightService {
  async generateDailyInsight(userId: string): Promise<{
    insight: string;
    confidence: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    reasoning: string;
    dataPoints: number;
  }>;
  
  async analyzePatterns(userContext: {
    habits: HabitEvent[];
    moods: JournalEntry[];
    checkIns: CheckInData[];
    timeframe: number; // days
  }): Promise<InsightResponse>;
  
  async personalizeCheckInQuestions(
    baseQuestions: Question[],
    userContext: UserContext
  ): Promise<Question[]>;
}

// Simple rule-based triggers (no ML)
class PatternDetectionService {
  detectDataSufficiency(userId: string): boolean; // min 5 days of data
  calculateMoodHabitOverlap(userId: string): Array<{habit: string, correlation: number}>;
  identifyStreakMilestones(userId: string): Achievement[];
}
```

## 🚦 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

**This Week:**
1. Add mood aggregation logic to handle multiple daily mood entries
2. Create `LLMInsightService` with structured prompting for daily insights
3. Update Home screen with collapsible daily summary card

**Next Week:**
1. Enhance Check-in screen with collapsible context section
2. Add insight feedback system (👍/👎) to improve LLM prompting
3. Update Journal History tab to show mood ranges and habit correlations

**Key Validation Metrics:**
- Do users engage with AI insights? (click "Show details", provide feedback)
- Does daily summary card increase check-in completion rates?
- Which insight formats resonate most? (track user feedback)

**Decision Points Resolved:**
- **Mood handling**: Multiple entries per day → calculate daily range for insights
- **AI approach**: LLM prompting with confidence levels, no statistical analysis
- **UI complexity**: Progressive disclosure with collapsible sections
- **Data architecture**: Extend existing schema rather than rebuild

The key is connecting the dots between what users DO (habits), how they FEEL (mood), and what they REFLECT on (check-ins/journal) into one cohesive story of personal growth and positive change.
