## 📱 **User Experience Flow**

```
First App Open
       ↓
   Onboarding Screens (5 steps)
       ↓
   Authentication (Sign Up/In)
       ↓
   First-Time Setup (3 steps)
       ↓ 
   Main App (Personalized)
       ↓
Future App Opens → Main App (Skip onboarding)
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **App State Management**
The main app (`AppWithOnboarding.tsx`) manages these states:
- `loading` - Checking stored onboarding status
- `onboarding` - Showing initial feature introduction
- `auth` - Authentication required
- `firstTimeSetup` - Personalization setup needed
- `main` - Full app experience

### **Persistence Strategy**
Uses AsyncStorage to track progress:
```typescript
// Storage keys used
'hasSeenOnboarding' - Boolean, initial onboarding completed
'onboardingComplete' - Boolean, full setup completed  
'selectedCoachStyle' - String, user's AI coach preference
'createdHabitsCount' - Number, habits created during setup
'setupCompletedAt' - ISO string, completion timestamp
```

### **State Transitions**
1. **App Launch** → Check storage → Determine appropriate screen
2. **Onboarding Complete** → Save seen flag → Show auth
3. **Authentication Success** → Check setup status → Show setup or main
4. **Setup Complete** → Save completion flag → Show main app
5. **Future Launches** → Skip directly to auth/main based on status

## 🎨 **Design Principles**

### **Progressive Disclosure**
- Introduce one concept at a time
- Build understanding before adding complexity
- Show value before asking for commitment

### **Personalization Early**

- Positive, encouraging messaging throughout

### **Accessibility & Usability**
- Large touch targets for easy navigation
- Clear visual hierarchy and readable fonts

## 📊 **Onboarding Metrics (Future Enhancement)**

**Key Success Indicators:**

- Time to complete full setup (target: <5 minutes)
- Habit selection diversity (target: >1 category)
- Day 7 retention rate (target: >60%)

## 🔄 **Onboarding Management**

### **Reset Capability**
For testing or user preference, onboarding can be reset:
```typescript
import { onboardingService } from './services/onboarding';
await onboardingService.resetOnboarding();
```

### **Status Checking**
Check current onboarding state:
```typescript
const status = await onboardingService.getOnboardingStatus();
// Returns: hasSeenOnboarding, hasCompletedSetup, etc.
```

### **Conditional Features**
Show different experiences based on onboarding state:
```typescript
const isRecentlyOnboarded = await onboardingService.isRecentlyOnboarded();
// Show extra help tips for users who completed setup <7 days ago
```

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Enable Onboarding in Your App**

Replace your main App.tsx:
```typescript
// Replace App.tsx content with AppWithOnboarding.tsx
import App from './src/AppWithOnboarding';
export default App;
```

### **2. Test the Full Flow**

**Reset onboarding for testing:**
```typescript
// Add to a debug screen or development menu
import { onboardingService } from './src/services/onboarding';

// Reset everything
await onboardingService.resetOnboarding();

// Reset just setup (keep onboarding seen)
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('onboardingComplete');
```

### **3. Customize for Your Brand**

**Update colors and styling:**
- Modify color schemes in each screen's StyleSheet
- Update coach style options and descriptions
- Customize habit suggestions for your target audience
- Adjust onboarding messaging and copy

**Add your own content:**

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

**"Onboarding shows every time"**
- Check AsyncStorage is working properly
- Verify `hasSeenOnboarding` is being saved
- Clear app data and test from fresh state

**"Setup screen doesn't show for new users"**
- Check authentication state management
- Verify `onboardingComplete` storage logic
- Ensure `isFirstTime` state is set correctly

**"Habits not creating during setup"**
- Check API connection and authentication
- Verify backend habit creation endpoints
- Check network connectivity and error handling

**"Coach style not saving"**
- Check user profile update API calls
- Verify backend user model supports coachStyle field
- Check local storage persistence

### **Debug Mode:**

Add debug logging to track onboarding flow:
```typescript
// Add to onboarding service methods
console.log('Onboarding status:', await onboardingService.getOnboardingStatus());
console.log('Should show setup:', await onboardingService.shouldShowFirstTimeSetup());
```
